## 3. add the other methods to the simulated data in the vignette





## Task List from May 6th meeting
## We agreed to work on the following by the next meeting, May 20th
## Paco agreed to do the coordinates function
## Matt agreed to do the residuals and coefficients functions
## Bryce agreed to write more tests for the package
## Jay agreed to continue working on the Vignette, adding examples
## from SRS, knn, and GRTS.

## Task List
##
## helper function to get coordinates from sp objects
## helper function to change coordinates from latlon to UTM
## put residuals into data.frame so they are matched with original records
##
## Vignette
## Background and Introduction of Method (Matt)
## Pre-analysis preparation
## Fit Model
## Diagnostics
## Prediction and Plotting

## Show analyses of our data sets

## Show sptotal has approximate covergae and unbiasedness for
## an example
## Compare to yimpute, spsurvey, simple random sample
##
## Test functions
##
## Add check for isotropy
## Possibly add split variogram plots by region
